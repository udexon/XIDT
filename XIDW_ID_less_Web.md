### XIDWeb: ID-less Web &mdash; One Small Step Towards Trekonomics

```
<joke>

One is always tempted to make a joke that may offend the most powerful groups of people on Earth, whenever possible:
- X is the symbol of Christ.
- Xi is a famous person.
- XID is the abbreviation of ID-less.
- Siths are the villains in Star Wars.
```

In hindsight, we find it difficult to explain what had gone wrong in the history of computing, that XIDWeb (pronounced "XID Web", ID-less Web) was not developed immediately following SSH. This may go down in history as one of the biggest technology mysteries as well as opportunities that will benefit literally all mankind.

Let's look at XIDWeb with practical examples first, so that we have something concrete as the foundation of our discussions.

1. Our story begins with Travis Tidwell's JSEncrypt, a "pure" (??) JavaScript library that is compatible with PHP OpenSSL asymmetric cryptographic encryption:

- https://github.com/travist/jsencrypt


2. We will incorporate JSEncrypt (JSE) into our own "raw and plain" JavaScript and PHP website:

3. We set up a local copy of the website above for development:

- http://localhost/PHP/phos/


```js
F("nxhr: phos_ajax.php xo: xsqrh: dummy_string")
F('a b c 9 3 + ON ECHO bv: doremi ssid: sstart: sstat: sid: init: ossl: putkps: pbk: ec:',"2je: xsend:")

F("responseText ix: imkey:")

F("hello_phos_0419 jecr:")
F("nxhr: phos_ajax.php xo: xsqrh: swap:") 
F('a b c 9 3 + ON ECHO bv: 0 si: 1 i: sstart: . getkps: dcr: ec:',"2je: xsend:") 

```

One is always tempted to make a joke that may offend the most powerful groups of people on Earth, whenever possible:
- X is the symbol of Christ.
- Xi is a famous person.
- XID is the abbreviation of ID-less.
- Siths are the villains in Star Wars.

This may go down in history as one of the biggest technology mysteries as well as opportunities that will benefit literally all mankind.

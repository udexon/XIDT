# Ownership of Information based on ID-less Transactions
XidTrans

Limit Background and Outcome for each article to 3 points each. Article, background and outcomes may have multiple levels, eg. technical vs. cultural. Must split article.
Use language and existing concepts that readers can understand.

A. Background
1. Rise of trillion dollar corporations, exploiting free software programmers, users' personal information; inequality in rewards between programmers and investors.
2. Russell, Stallman, Graham, Bill Gates
3. Star Trek. Missing science to make fantasies real. What if Kirk comes back to 2020?

B. Outcome
1. Make income per unit time for programmers more equitable to investors
2. Everyone can receive education like Bertrand Russell.
Just address A1 and B1.

Use all character limit in Reddit programming title when posting, give readers as many details as possible

If Kirk and Spock time travelled back to 2020, what would they have done?
Missing from science fiction is the science that make the fantasies real. 
Is there anyone else working on similar or better ideas like mine? How to discover them? This is a technical problem.

The advent of the Internet and social networks have given rise to many multibillion dollar software companies in the past few decades. However, this coincides with the increasingly heavy lobbying of the United States government by faceless corporations, culminating in scandalous controversies such as, but not limited to, Edward Snowden's disclosures and net neutrality, confirming the trend that fundamental issues such as individual ownership of personal information will not receive sufficient attention from conscientious politicians in the foreseeable terms of presidency, the  Congress as well as the Senate. 
Fortunately, we may have finally reached a stage where technologies can enable users to regulate themselves, without interference or disruption by huge corporations and laws sponsored by them.
Consider the history of free and open source software development, where literally millions if not more individual programmers contributed perhaps billions of lines of code for ___FREE___, which were in turn exploited by trillion dollar corporations to create the largest ever network infrastructure, secretly mining users' personal information on servers in unknown locations, while making a handful of shareholders the richest people on Earth and paying untold amount of lobbying fees to corrupt politicians. 
Of course we cannot dismiss the benefits received by the individual programmers themselves, in terms of social mobility as a result of learning computer programming through free software. A majority of these programmers hail from developing countries, where just a generation ago, their families might have had their first family car or television, made in Taiwan or Japan, perhaps funded by the same group of investors who funded the new MAGAF cartel.

From Bertrand Russell to Richard Stallman and Paul Graham.

A man (woman + LGBTQXYZ) must be engaged in a profession least influenced by globalized lobby money to stay intellectually conscientious. 


Most of today's Internet and social networks are based on the now nearly half a century old Unix User ID authentication.

### XidWeb: ID-less Web
The Unix User ID convention, based on symmetric cryptography, has shaped perhaps all of today authentication systems by way of forking software from the GNU Linux free software movement. Although asymmetric cryptography has been widely used in many applications, e.g. cryptocurrencies, browser session authentication etc., they are not completely removed from Unix style user ID, perhaps due to preconditioned mindset of the developers, who are too used to the Unix User ID convention. Although also based on asymmetric cryptography, XidWeb (ID-less Web), employing ID-less transactions protocol (XIDT), is a radical creation that departs completely from the principles and philosophies of Unix User ID, making it possible to serve as an intermediate and interface system amongst existing centralized Unix style authentication systems, as well as an ultimate protection of personal privacy, die to its distributed ownership and pactically uncrackable nature. 
- So how does XidTrans or XidWeb affect individual ownership of personal information?
- How important is this issue?
Consider the following scenario
- A user may choose the method to exchange a piece of information he (she) owns, for a quantity of currency that he (she) agrees to.

Use Reddit to illustrate. Existing karma system, not convertible to national currency.
1. Build XidTrans money transfer
2. Earn money as you learn
A detailed account of EMYL is enough as an article to publish. Use this as foundation for readers to understand significance of XidWeb.

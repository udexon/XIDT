### Part II: XIDWeb (ID-less Web) and Trekonomics

- ([Source](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/Beyond_Rosetta.md#conclusions)) _The Free Software Revolution 2.0 might just be the threshold that will usher in the Star Trek society. If the year 2020 A.D. (C.E.) is marked by Trump and Coronavirus and the biggest global economic depression since Wordl War II, then perhaps Free Software Revolution 2.0 may unleash several essential elements that will shape a new era, much like how national currencies, automobiles, air travel and Internet shaped the post WWII period._

Compared to dark web related projects such as Tor and I2P, which primarily focus on transport layer anonymity, XIDWeb is radical paradigm shift at the application layer.

As there are many types of applications that XIDWeb can be deployed in, we want to focus on one particular area which has a short implementation period and a large user base:

ID-less Web

Colon definition words make it much easier to control permission for execution.  Different aliases for same function may have different permissions.

Server generate a new key pairs for each client. Client must send a message encrypted with server public key PBKS, so that server can authenticate message is from specific client. 

Meanings and concepts concerning user, session etc, need to be revised, based on Cryptographic Key Chain (CKC).

-  This "key-chaining" system is the immediate ancestor of the Blockchain technology in vogue today. 

Conventional key pairs are generated by server &mdash; Users do not have computing devices capable of generating keys. Now it is level playing field.

Metashellet makes transient key cryptography accessible to all &mdash; a new virgin field to be explored. With the promise of leading towards Trekonomics.

Today's financial system, faceless individuals decide how much to tax you at anytime.

With ID-less Web, they cannot, as they have no access to the records of your transactions and your wallet, be it physical, bank or cryptocurrencies.

- The chain of key pairs and TUID (temporary user ID) by a user can be used to uniquely identify a user, similar to blockchain, but more flexible and fundamental, as TUID may be changed by a user any time arbitrarily, and there is no centralized body to manage them.

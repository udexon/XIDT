## Part II: XIDWeb (ID-less Web) and Trekonomics

The modern banking system, where an account holder is required to reproduce his or her signature for verification by a teller, is very much analogous to how a user is required to enter his or her own password, to be verified by the authentication module of a Unix style user system, or similar derivatives, especially websites. 

In both the banks and Unix style systems, the user identity management is centralized, resulting in an asymmetric or unbalanced relationship between the user and the system. 

_To the best of our knowledge, no theoretical or practical alternative solution has been established to overcome this situation. We believe ours is an unprecedented attempt, thus enabling us to claim that it is a big step towards an idealistic Star Trek society, where personal freedom is enshrined._

In hindsight, talks of personal freedom by Western commentators sounded totally hollow, as figures like Martin Luther King or even Noam Chomsky did not seem to demonstrate knowledge concerning the banking tyranny as described above. 

To be fair, "thought leaders" like King and Chomsky were active during the Cold War, where the _ALLERGED_ threats of Communism were much greater than that of Capitalism, which has grown to be less appealing in recent years, especially in the light of China's economic growth and repeated financial crises, believed to be manipulated by uber bankers in the Western world.

In short, the belief that _tax and fiat money being the twin masters of all evils_ is gaining greater popularity by the day, only to be limited by the rate of death of old people who believe otherwise.

In this respect, XIDWeb or XIDT (ID-less Transactions) overcome the banking tyranny at its roots.

As there are many types of applications that XIDWeb can be deployed in, we want to focus on one particular area which has a short implementation period and a large user base:

- https://github.com/udexon/EMYL/blob/master/E003_Online_Tipping.md

- https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/Beyond_Rosetta.md#project-e-international-money-transfer-including-cryptocurrencies-and-online-tipping

XIDWeb aims to beat the banking tyranny at its own game &mdash; Capitalism. We subscribe to the definition of Capitalism as a mode of free market competition, without kleptocracy that selectively bails out preferred assets during crises. XIDWeb aims to start small &mdash; ID-less Online Tipping (XIDOT). We are _NOT_ going after super billionaires &mdash; we just want to enrich and enable net users: allowing them to earn one penny at a time, from anyone in the world, which would be impossible or impractical to police.

This also creates the much need source of income to sustain other XIDWeb projects in the long term.

As to whether we are able to make it, it really depends on one thing: whether we are able to recruit 10 collaborators (voluntary or incentivized) to complete the XIDOT prototype on a part time basis over the next 6 months.


### Communism, Capitalism & Confucianism

Communism and Capitalism are not mutually exclusive, as demonstrated by Confucianism in China and overseas Chinese communities.

Unfortunately, Confuciansim can only be understood if you have learned the Chinese language and lived in China or with the overseas Chinese communities.

Confucianism is required to explain the fundamental philosophy behind XIDWeb &mdash; a term that may seem to have many contradictions in itself.


- ([Source](https://github.com/udexon/Metashellet/blob/master/Beyond_Rosetta.md#conclusions)) _The Free Software Revolution 2.0 might just be the threshold that will usher in the Star Trek society. If the year 2020 A.D. (C.E.) is marked by Trump and Coronavirus and the biggest global economic depression since Wordl War II, then perhaps Free Software Revolution 2.0 may unleash several essential elements that will shape a new era, much like how national currencies, automobiles, air travel and Internet shaped the post WWII period._

Liberté, égalité, fraternité, ID-less

Compared to dark web related projects such as Tor and I2P, which primarily focus on transport layer anonymity, XIDWeb is radical paradigm shift at the application layer.


ID-less Web

Colon definition words make it much easier to control permission for execution.  Different aliases for same function may have different permissions.

Server generate a new key pairs for each client. Client must send a message encrypted with server public key PBKS, so that server can authenticate message is from specific client. 

Meanings and concepts concerning user, session etc, need to be revised, based on Cryptographic Key Chain (CKC).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient-key_cryptography

-  This "key-chaining" system is the immediate ancestor of the Blockchain technology in vogue today. 

Conventional key pairs are generated by server &mdash; Users do not have computing devices capable of generating keys. Now it is level playing field.

Metashellet makes transient key cryptography accessible to all &mdash; a new virgin field to be explored. With the promise of leading towards Trekonomics.

Today's financial system, faceless individuals decide how much to tax you at anytime.

With ID-less Web, they cannot, as they have no access to the records of your transactions and your wallet, be it physical, bank or cryptocurrencies.

https://github.com/udexon/XIDT#a-new-type-of-blockchain-based-on-id-less-transactions

- The chain of key pairs and TUID (temporary user ID) by a user can be used to uniquely identify a user, similar to blockchain, but more flexible and fundamental, as TUID may be changed by a user any time arbitrarily, and there is no centralized body to manage them.
